According to the Oxford Dictionary, Christianity is "the religion based on the person and teachings of Jesus Christ, or its beliefs and practices". Similarly, the bible defines Christianity as the practice of being like Christ (**Acts 11:26**). Following Jesus Christ and His person is what being a Christian is all about. As Christians, we constantly pray and study the word of God to become more like him and get to know him better (**2 Timothy 2:15, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-17**).

However, a surprising amount of Christians' journey in faith ends there. They pray and study; they might even speak in tongues but their lives are the same. After praying for 1 hour, after diligently studying the word, they remain the same. There is no difference between their lifestyle and the average unbeliever. This is not supposed to be the case.

The Bible says we have been called out of the kingdom of darkness into his light (**1 Peter 2:9**). We're no longer subject to the control of our sinful nature (**Romans 6:6-7**); we're now in a different kingdom where we have the holy spirit to guide us into all truths (**John 16:13**). However, we become more like christ and get more into his image by studying and applying the word of God (**James 1:22**). A lot of Christians read the bible like another book. Some others study it in depth asking the holy spirit to teach them. However, the amount to which you read the word of God, how many chapters you read, and how many times you read cover to cover is not important unless you apply the word of God to your life. Like actually do what it says (**2 Corinthians 3:18**). We obviously can't do any of these on our own which is why we need the help of the holy spirit. But you can't forget to actually take the first step (**Proverbs 16:9**) and God will be there for you throughout the way.

In summary, a lot of Christians' life stay the same because of their failure to practice what they learn in the bible. Being a Christian entails a change from your previous lifestyle to a new one. This cannot come however without praying, studying and most importantly applying the word of God. Remember to constantly fellowship with the lord and see your life change for the better as you become more like Christ.
